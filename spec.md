# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application - this is in the cli.rb file; welcome's the user, generates and displays the list of craft coffee brewers in Seattle (including the neighborhood), asks which they would like to read the description of (or exit), user enters number and app pulls the description, then app asks if they would like to read about another brewer (or exit).

- [x] Pull data from an external source - the list, neighborhood and description are all pulled from a thrillist webpage about Seattle craft coffee brewers.

- [x] Implement both list and detail views - when calling 'seattle_craft_coffee', first the list of craft coffee brewers and their neighborhood are generated/displayed, then when the user enters which one they want the description of, the app pulls the detailed description of the brewer, with the name of the brewer as the header of the information (so the user knows the correct description was provided).
